# 👋🏽 Hi!  

I'm Gerald Tuimaleali'ifano aka GT, an SRE, DevOps Engineer and aspiring content creator.

When I'm not building cool environments using tools like AWS, K8s, Helm, Terraform, Terragrunt, FluxCD, Jenkins, Python etc.. I volunteer for the [Pasifika Tech Education Charity (PTEC)](https://www.pasifikateched.net/).  

PTECs' goal is to share technical knowledge and experience from the tech industry with the Pasifika community. We believe that we can inspire the next generation of Pasifika technical leaders 💪🏽 🚀
