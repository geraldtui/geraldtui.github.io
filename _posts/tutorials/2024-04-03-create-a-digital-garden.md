## **Install Jekyll**

*Use [Jekyll Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll and its dependencies


## **You will need these to customize and deploy Jekyll**
-  [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
-  [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
-  [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - or your preferred code editor

## **Use the Chirpy Theme to create and deploy the site**

### Step 1: Clone the [chirpy-starter](https://github.com/new?template_name=chirpy-starter&template_owner=cotes2020) GitHub repo

- Name your repository `<username>.github.io` (replace `username` with your github username).
- Select `Public` > `Create Repository`

### Step 2: Your website is up and running! üéâ
By the time you finish reading this line, your website would've already been published to GitHub pages and available on `https://<username>.github.io`

What are you waiting for? Go ahead and check it out üôÇ

To check your site deployment status, go to the `Code` section of your GitHub repository. Find the deployment status at the bottom right of the page and click for more details.

## **Time to Customize**

### Step 1: Clone the repo to your local machine

```console
git clone git@<YOUR-USER-NAME>/<YOUR-REPO-NAME>.git
```

### Step 2: Install Chirpy Dependencies
```console
cd <repo name>
bundle
```


### Step 3: Update Configuration

In the root directory, edit `_config.yaml` to set these basic properties. While there are many other properties that can alter the site's configuration, these will suffice for now.

-  `title` = your website title (line 17)
-  `tagline` = line that will go under the title (line 19)
-  `url` = your github pages site (line 26)
-  `name` = used as author for all posts (line 37)

_'_config.yaml' file_



### Step 4: Run Local Server

```console
bundle exec jekyll s
```

This should start the site on http://127.0.0.1:4000

## Create Your First Post
We write all posts in markdown language (`.md`) and keep them in the `_posts` folder.

### Step 1: Install Jekyll plugins
Jekyll has some cool plugins that help you whip up post templates super quick.

To your `Gemfile` in the root directory, add this line:
```console
gem 'jekyll-compose', group: [:jekyll_plugins]
```

Re-run the `bundle` command to install the Jekyll plugins:
```console
bundle
```

Run this to create a new post:
```console
bundle exec jekyll post "Hello World"
```

It will generate a new markdown file in `_posts`. Notice the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-hello-world.md`

### Step 2: Add These Properties To Your Post
Give it a category and some tags
```yaml
categories: [category]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
```

### Step 3: Add Markdown Text
```markdown

### Deploy to GitHub
Commit and push your changes to your github remote repo to automatically deploy your site.
